# RISC-Processor-on-FPGA
Verilog implimentation of a 5-stage RISC processor. Will most likely not ever be fully capable.
Made using Quartus and simulated with ModelSim.

How to use:
  Hard code the instructions into the instruction memory and hard code default states in RF.

Progress:
  + rough outline of PC, IF, ID, EXE
  + 2 bit instructions
  + 8 bit data width
  - WB not complete
  - No MEM
  - ALU only can add 2 reg
